$ git init
	The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an existing,
 	unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new,empty repository.
 	Most other Git commands are not available outside of an initialized repository, 
	so this is usually the first command you'll run in a new project.
$ git add "file_name or -A for all_file".
	The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.
 	It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. 
	However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant wayâ€”changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit.
$ git commit -m 
$ git checkout "file_name or -f for all file".
